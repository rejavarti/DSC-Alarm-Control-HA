# ESP32 Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problem
The ESP32 ESP-IDF 5.3.2+ system was getting stuck in an infinite loop, repeatedly logging:
```
[D][dsc_keybus:245]: System stabilized - initializing DSC Keybus hardware (timers, interrupts)...
```

This occurred when:
1. ESP-IDF timer verification failed with error 258
2. Enhanced timer pre-initialization repeatedly failed
3. Hardware initialization couldn't complete due to timer issues
4. No permanent failure state was set, causing endless retries

## Root Cause
The system had some timeout protections (60 seconds for timer verification) but lacked proper circuit breaker logic for:
- Timer pre-initialization failures
- Hardware initialization failure detection
- Permanent failure state management

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Timer Pre-initialization Circuit Breaker
**File**: `extras/ESPHome/components/dsc_keybus/dsc_keybus.cpp`

- **Attempt Tracking**: Added `timer_init_attempts` counter
- **Attempt Limit**: Maximum 10 attempts for timer initialization
- **Timeout Protection**: 120-second maximum time for all timer init attempts
- **Permanent Failure**: Calls `markInitializationFailed()` when limits exceeded
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays between attempts (5s + 1s per attempt)
- **Enhanced Logging**: Shows attempt counts and timing information

### 2. Enhanced Hardware Initialization Failure Detection
**Files**: `extras/ESPHome/components/dsc_keybus/dsc_wrapper.cpp`, `dsc_wrapper.h`

- **Failure Detection**: Properly detects when `esp32_hardware_initialized` remains false
- **Permanent Failure Logic**: Marks initialization as permanently failed after 3 attempts or 60 seconds
- **New Method**: Added `markInitializationFailed()` to set permanent failure state
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better success/failure messages with attempt counts

### 3. Circuit Breaker Integration
- **Permanent Failure State**: Once marked as failed, system stops retrying indefinitely
- **ESPHome Integration**: Component recognizes permanent failure and stops initialization loop
- **Rate Limiting**: Existing rate limiting prevents log spam during the fix process

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Normal Case (Timer works)
```
[D][dsc_keybus:043]: Initialized ESP-IDF stabilization timestamp: 199 ms
[D][dsc_keybus:296]: Pre-initializing ESP-IDF 5.3.2+ timer system for DSC interface
[D][dsc_keybus:308]: ESP-IDF timer system pre-initialization successful after 1 attempts
[I][dsc_wrapper:134]: DSC Classic hardware initialization successful on attempt 1
```

### Timer Failure Case (Fixed - No Infinite Loop)
```
[D][dsc_keybus:043]: Initialized ESP-IDF stabilization timestamp: 199 ms
[W][dsc_keybus:274]: ESP-IDF 5.3.2+ timer system not ready - deferring hardware init (error: 258)
[W][dsc_keybus:282]: Timer system check exceeded 60 seconds - forcing continuation to prevent infinite loop
[D][dsc_keybus:296]: Pre-initializing ESP-IDF 5.3.2+ timer system for DSC interface
[W][dsc_keybus:301]: Failed to pre-initialize ESP-IDF timer system (attempt 1/10) - will retry after delay
[W][dsc_keybus:301]: Failed to pre-initialize ESP-IDF timer system (attempt 2/10) - will retry after delay
...
[E][dsc_keybus:XXX]: Enhanced timer system initialization permanently failed after 10 attempts over 45000 ms
[E][dsc_keybus:XXX]: ESP-IDF 5.3.2+ timer compatibility issue - marking initialization as permanently failed
[E][dsc_wrapper:XXX]: DSC hardware initialization marked as permanently failed
[E][dsc_keybus:XXX]: DSC Keybus hardware initialization has failed - component non-functional
```

## Key Improvements

1. **No More Infinite Loops**: System will never get stuck repeating the same message indefinitely
2. **Proper Failure Detection**: All failure modes are detected and handled appropriately  
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Users get clear indication when initialization fails permanently
4. **Resource Protection**: Prevents wasting CPU/memory on endless failed attempts
5. **Better Diagnostics**: Enhanced logging helps troubleshoot the root cause
6. **Graceful Degradation**: System fails cleanly rather than hanging

## Files Modified
- `extras/ESPHome/components/dsc_keybus/dsc_keybus.cpp` - Main fix implementation
- `extras/ESPHome/components/dsc_keybus/dsc_wrapper.cpp` - Enhanced failure handling  
- `extras/ESPHome/components/dsc_keybus/dsc_wrapper.h` - New method declaration

## Testing
- All existing infinite loop tests continue to pass
- New timer circuit breaker tests validate the enhanced protection
- Manual validation confirms all key components are present
- Code compiles successfully with proper syntax
