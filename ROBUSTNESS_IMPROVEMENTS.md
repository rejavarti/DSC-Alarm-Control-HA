## Installation & Configuration

### 1. Update Arduino Code
1. Replace your existing `.ino` file with the enhanced version
2. Update configuration variables at the top of the file:
   ```cpp
   const char* wifiSSID = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
   const char* wifiPassword = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
   const char* accessCode = "YOUR_ACCESS_CODE";
   const char* mqttServer = "YOUR_MQTT_SERVER";
   const char* mqttUsername = "YOUR_MQTT_USERNAME";
   const char* mqttPassword = "YOUR_MQTT_PASSWORD";
   ```

### 2. Home Assistant Configuration
1. Copy relevant sections from `HA_Yaml_Enhanced.YAML` to your `configuration.yaml`
2. Create a `secrets.yaml` file for sensitive information:
   ```yaml
   dsc_alarm_code: "YOUR_ALARM_CODE"
   mqtt_username: "YOUR_MQTT_USERNAME"
   mqtt_password: "YOUR_MQTT_PASSWORD"
   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant

### 3. Monitoring Setup
Add these entities to your dashboard for system monitoring:
- `sensor.dsc_system_uptime`
- `sensor.dsc_free_memory`  
- `sensor.dsc_wifi_signal_strength`
- `binary_sensor.dsc_system_health`
- `binary_sensor.dsc_keybus_connected`

## Security Considerations

### Enhanced Security Features:
1. **Credential Management**: Template configuration prevents accidental credential exposure
2. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive bounds checking prevents buffer overflows
3. **Access Control**: Improved access code validation and logging
4. **Audit Trail**: Detailed logging of all security actions
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

### Production Deployment Recommendations:
1. Use MQTT with TLS encryption
2. Store credentials in secrets.yaml or external credential store
3. Consider using WiFiManager for over-the-air credential updates
4. Enable MQTT authentication
5. Regularly monitor system health sensors
6. Set up alerts for system troubles
