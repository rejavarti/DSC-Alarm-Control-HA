# ESP32 "Calling app_main()" Hang Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed ESP32 hanging at "Calling app_main()" when using ESPHome with ESP-IDF framework. This issue occurred during the early initialization phase when the ESP32 would boot successfully through the bootloader but hang when entering the main application.

## Root Cause Analysis
The hang at "app_main()" was caused by insufficient memory allocation for critical ESP-IDF tasks during initialization, specifically:

1. **Main Task Stack Overflow**: ESP-IDF default main task stack size (3584 bytes) was insufficient for DSC Keybus initialization
2. **System Event Task Memory**: Default system event task stack was too small for WiFi and DSC event handling
3. **WiFi Task Memory**: Insufficient memory for WiFi initialization with concurrent DSC processing
4. **Timer Task Stack**: FreeRTOS timer task stack was inadequate for DSC real-time timing requirements
5. **Watchdog Configuration**: Watchdog timer was not properly initialized early enough in the boot process

## Solution Implementation

### 1. ESP-IDF Memory Configuration
Added comprehensive `sdkconfig_options` to all ESP32 ESPHome configurations:

```yaml
esp32:
  board: esp32dev
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    version: 5.1.4
    platform_version: 6.4.0
    
    sdkconfig_options:
      # Main task stack - CRITICAL for preventing app_main() hang
      CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE: "16384"  # Increased from 3584 to 16KB
      
      # System and WiFi task stacks
      CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_EVENT_TASK_STACK_SIZE: "4096"
      CONFIG_ESP32_WIFI_TASK_STACK_SIZE: "6144"
      CONFIG_FREERTOS_TIMER_TASK_STACK_DEPTH: "4096"
      
      # Memory management optimizations
      CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE: "64"
      CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ: "1000"
      
      # Early watchdog initialization
      CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_S: "30"
      CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_EN: y
      CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_INIT: y
      
      # Disable power management for consistent DSC timing
      CONFIG_PM_ENABLE: n
```

### 2. Enhanced Component Initialization
Improved the DSC component setup with early watchdog and memory checks:

```cpp
void DSCKeybusComponent::setup() {
#ifdef ESP32
  // Early watchdog configuration for ESP-IDF
  esp_err_t wdt_err = esp_task_wdt_init(30, true);
  if (wdt_err == ESP_OK) {
    esp_task_wdt_add(NULL);
    ESP_LOGD(TAG, "ESP32 watchdog timer configured for setup");
  }
  
  // Check available heap memory before proceeding
  size_t free_heap = esp_get_free_heap_size();
  if (free_heap < 50000) {
    ESP_LOGW(TAG, "Low heap memory detected: %zu bytes free", free_heap);
  }
#endif
  // ... rest of setup
}
```

### 3. Fixed Files
Updated all ESP32 ESPHome configurations:
- `DscAlarm_ESP32.yaml`
- `DscAlarm_Classic_ESP32.yaml` 
- `test_compile_esp32.yaml`
- `test_watchdog_esp32.yaml`

## Testing Results

[System hangs here - no further output]
```

### ✅ After Fix (Working)
```
I (623) main_task: Calling app_main()

## Migration Guide

### Automatic Fix
No configuration changes required for existing users. The fix is automatically applied when updating to the latest version:

1. **Update component** to latest version
2. **Clean build cache**: `esphome clean your_config.yaml`
3. **Compile and flash**: `esphome run your_config.yaml`

### Custom Configurations
If you have custom ESP32 configurations, add the ESP-IDF memory optimizations:

```yaml
# Include this fix in your ESP32 ESPHome configurations
<<: !include esp32_espidf_fix.yaml
```

Or copy the `sdkconfig_options` section from any of the updated configuration files.
